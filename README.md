## Fundamentals
React is a library. It lets you put components together but it **does not prescribe how to do routing and data fetching**. To build an entire React app you should use a full-stack React framework like Next.js or Remix.

Frameworks that implement React let you fetch data in **asynchronous components that run on the server or even during the build**.

## Describing the UI
React lets you combine your custom markup, CSS and JavaScript into custom components, reuseable UI elements. 

### Markup
Return statements can be written all on one line, as this component:

```tsx
return <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg" alt="Katherine Johnson" />;
```
But if your markup is not on the same line as return keyword, you must wrap it in a pair of parentheses:

```tsx
return (
  <div>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg" alt="Katherine Johnson" />
  </div>
);
```

### What the browser sees
Notice the difference in casing:
- ```<section></section> ``` is lowercase, so React knows we refer to a HTML tag
- ```<Profile /> ``` starts with capital letter, so React knows that we want to use our component

### Nesting and organizing components
Because the Profile components are rendered inside Gallery‚Äîeven several times!‚Äî we can say that Gallery is a parent component, rendering each Profile as a ‚Äúchild‚Äù.

Components can render other components, but you must never nest their definitions:

```tsx
export default function Gallery() {
  // üî¥ Never define a component inside another component!
  function Profile() {
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}
```
The snippet above is very slow and causes bugs. Instead, define every component at the top level.

When a child component needs some data from a parent, **pass it by props instead of nesting definitions**.
